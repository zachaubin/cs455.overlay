start registry on port x

start msgnode at registry host on port x

. msgnode sends it's info to reg
. reg sends registration status
. reg sends node manifest



// as of thursday
registry node listens
msging node opens thread to send

oh no, use nio socketchannels instead of sockets oh my

LAB2:
registry must start first
can init app in terminal or TMUX sessions

we run from jar file

create a start-nodes.sh
identify list of peers to start messagingnodes on a with a conf/machine_list file
used to test in lab
THIS .sh lives in same directory as build bin src

conf dir contains 'log4j2.xml' 'machine_list'

see slides for contents of start-nodes.sh
for machine in 'cat machine list'::: this iterates over machines in list
do line sshs into each and runs

::

need to do in parallel:
accept new connect
list....
^this all in slides

tcp rec thread
one per connection
terminate when connection terminates

tcp server thread
one per node
thread dies when node dies

tcp sender
"thread-optional"

tcpConnection
made to encapsulate the other three tcp things
this is an optional class

::

THREADS
implements Runnable
Probably don't want to extend Thread since cannot extend other stuff

call Thread's .start() to run the run()


concurrency issues are handled with Synchronization
synchronized ensures thread is unique while running....<<see slide
TAKES TIME

see

relay tracker is counting how many you forward
send tracker counts initial sends

Q&A
deregistering only happens BEFORE routing table has been established
this means network topology is established with a set number of nodes and stays


start script is good for spawning 10 nodes
    after that works get list nodes command working in concurrency
        rest will come together after you can build from there
       initial topology is hardest


when receiving message in thread, PASS REFERENCE TO CALLING NODE!!!!!

TCPConnectionsCache can be useful to add connection, remove connection, print all messaging nodes
